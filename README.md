CREDIT CARD LEAD GENERATION PREDICTION
About The Dataset
In this project or case, the bank wants to cross-sell its credit cards to its existing customers.the bank has identified a set of customers that are eligible for taking these credit cards

This dataset is taking from "KAGGLE"

Problem Statement:
TO predict which individuals or groups of people are most likely to apply for a credit card in "NEAR FUTURE"
Project Aim:
The aim of this prediction is to identify potential customers who are more likeye to be intersted in credit card.
In this project i used "FOUR" machine learning algorithm and check which algorithm perform well on this data.

The algorithms are.

1.Logestic Regression

2.Decision Tree

3.Random Forest

4.Ada boost Classifer
